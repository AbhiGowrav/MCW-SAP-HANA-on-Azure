## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to provision a highly avilable deployment of SAP HANA in Azure. Throughout the whiteboard design session and the hands-on lab, you will look at the planning process for SAP HANA migration and deployment. You will identify and implement Azure infrastructure components necessary to support a clustered deployment of SAP HANA. You will also step through installing SAP HANA and configuring SAP HANA system replication. Finally, you will review and test different scenarios that involve manual and automatic failover between cluster nodes. 

### Whiteboard Design Session
In this workshop, you will look at what is involved in deploying SAP HANA on Azure with the goals of designing for high availability, disaster recovery as well as supportability. 

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to better design and deploy SAP HANA on Azure.


### Hand-on Lab
