# SAP HANA on Azure

Contoso, a pharmaceutical company, wants to significantly reduce server and storage hardware in their own datacenters to minimize IT related costs. The leadership asked Contoso IT to look into the possibility of migrating its SAP HANA environment to cloud. Contoso also wants to dramatically simplify the process of provisioning Azure resources, as well as installation and configuration of SAP HANA software components. Contoso IT has been relying on Ansible to manage its on-premises environment and, with the cloud migration plans, it started evaluating the use of Terraform to automate on-premises and cloud-based deployments.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to provision a highly available deployment of SAP HANA in Azure. Throughout the whiteboard design session and the hands-on lab, you will look at the planning process for SAP HANA migration and deployment. You will identify and implement Azure infrastructure components necessary to support a clustered deployment of SAP HANA. You will also step through installing SAP HANA and configuring SAP HANA system replication. Finally, you will review and test different scenarios that involve manual and automatic failover between cluster nodes.

At the end of this workshop you will be able to better design and deploy SAP HANA on Azure. After its completion, you will be able to provision Azure infrastructure components necessary to support highly available SAP HANA deployments, configure Azure virtual machines to support highly available SAP HANA installations, implement SUSE Linux Enterprise clustering, install SAP HANA, configure SAP HANA system replication, and test high availability scenarios.
